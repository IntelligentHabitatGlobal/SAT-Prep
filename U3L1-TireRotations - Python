The 36 -inch tires on a pickup truck have a circumference of 9.42 feet. 
To the nearest whole rotation, how many rotations must the tires make 
for the truck to travel 2 miles in a straight line? (1 mile=5,280 feet)



# Calculate the total distance in feet
miles = 2
feet_per_mile = 5280
total_feet = miles * feet_per_mile

# Tire circumference in feet
circumference_feet = 9.42

# Calculate the number of rotations
rotations = total_feet / circumference_feet

# Round to the nearest whole number
rounded_rotations = round(rotations)

print(f"Total distance in feet: {total_feet}")
print(f"Number of rotations: {rotations}")
print(f"Rounded rotations: {rounded_rotations}")
